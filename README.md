This is the final project written in D3 library for Udacity's Data Visualizatin course. It's an iteractive graph to explore data relationships between physical characteristics and performance in baseball. The graph allows changing X-Axis and Y-Axis along with data updates in real time. It also uses D3's collision force to display data aggregation on one spot.
